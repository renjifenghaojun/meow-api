// revokeOAuthBridgeTokens is a one-time, idempotent startup migration that
// revokes every relay API key minted through the removed POST /oauth2/keys
// bridge — that is, every Token whose oauth_client_id is non-empty. OAuth access
// tokens now drive the business endpoints directly through their own scopes, so
// these bridge-minted keys are no longer issued and any surviving ones must be
// invalidated to force integrations onto the access-token path.
//
// Idempotency and safety:
//   - The filter matches only rows whose oauth_client_id is a non-empty string.
//     Keys a user created directly carry an empty string, and legacy rows carry
//     SQL NULL (for which the inequality is unknown, never true), so no non-OAuth
//     key is ever touched.
//   - Token uses gorm soft delete, so a second run matches nothing (already
//     soft-deleted rows carry deleted_at) and reports zero — safe to run on every
//     startup across SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL.
//
// This runs inside InitDB, before InitRedisClient connects the cache, so the
// Redis client is normally nil here and the guarded invalidation is skipped.
// That is safe: a freshly started process has no local cache, and any entry
// left in an external shared cache expires within its short TTL. When a client
// is already connected the cache is invalidated first so a revoked key stops
// authenticating immediately; a cache error is logged but never aborts the
// migration (the next lookup re-hydrates from the database and finds the row gone).
