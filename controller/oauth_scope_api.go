// OAuthWalletBalance answers the wallet.read half that reports the owner's
// balance, for the OAuth-scoped API group (GET /oauth2/api/wallet). It is a
// deliberately slim alternative to GetSelf: the wallet.read scope grants a look
// at the quota balance only, so this returns just the remaining and used quota
// and never the identity, affiliate, payment-customer or setting fields GetSelf
// exposes. The top-up options half of wallet.read is served by GetTopUpInfo.
//
// The owner is taken from the request context (set by DashboardScopeAuth from the
// access token), never from a request parameter, so there is no cross-user path.
